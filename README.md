# Deep-Learning
Deep Learning Course - Sharif University of Technology
- Instructor: Prof. Mahdiyeh Soleymani

## 1- Optimization, PyTorch, and NN
This assignment contains 3 main parts:
- Optimization Algorithms: Here we have implemented different well-known optimization algorithms on the Ackley and Beale functions.
- NN from scratch: Here we have implemented neural networkd from scratch.
- PyTorch: In this notebook we got familiar with different PyTorch function which are widely used in the field of deep learning.

## 2- Yolo, CNN, and Colorization
## 3- GPT, RNN, and BERT
