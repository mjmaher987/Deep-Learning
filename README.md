## 1. Optimization, PyTorch, and NN  
This assignment contains 3 main parts:  
- **Optimization Algorithms:**  
  Implemented well-known optimization algorithms (e.g., SGD, Adam, RMSProp) on benchmark functions like Ackley and Beale to understand their behavior.  
- **NN from Scratch:**  
  Designed and implemented a neural network from scratch without relying on deep learning libraries to grasp the fundamentals of forward and backward propagation.  
- **PyTorch:**  
  Explored PyTorch's core functionalities, such as tensor operations, autograd, and model training utilities, to familiarize ourselves with this powerful deep learning framework.

## 2. YOLO, CNN, and Colorization  
This assignment focuses on:  
- **YOLO (You Only Look Once):**  
  Implemented object detection using the YOLO framework to identify objects in images with high accuracy and speed.  
- **CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks):**  
  Designed and trained CNNs for image classification tasks to understand feature extraction and spatial hierarchies.  
- **Colorization:**  
  Built a model to convert grayscale images into realistic colorized versions, exploring the applications of CNNs in creative tasks.

  Fine-tuned GPT to generate coherent and context-aware text based on given prompts.  
- **RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks):**  
  Implemented RNNs and LSTMs for sequence modeling tasks like text generation and sentiment analysis.  
- **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers):**  
  Fine-tuned BERT for downstream tasks like question answering and sentiment classification.

This assignment dives into generative models:  
- **DDPM (Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models):**  
  Implemented DDPMs to generate high-quality synthetic data through iterative noise removal.  
- **GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks) and VAE (Variational Autoencoders):**  
  Explored GANs for realistic image generation and VAEs for representation learning and controlled generation.
